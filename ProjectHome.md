A simple application to allow remote viewing of a desktop and control of the mouse and keyboard of the remote machine. Uses:

  * An alternative to a KVM switch
  * For remote monitoring of PCs
  * For remote PC support
  * As an alternative to VNC

Developed purely in Java, this application should run on any machine with a JVM 1.2 or above installed. It has been tested on Windows XP, Windows 98, Mac OS(on a Mac Mini), Suse Linux and Red Hat Linux.
